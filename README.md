# CO2GDP
Kaggle Datasets, see who the largest producers or of GDP and CO2 and see if  they can be separated.

This was done using two datasets from Kaggle and completed in Google Big Query. The idea was to see which countries were the largest producers of both CO2 and GDP and then see if they could be separated. 
When looking at the code, you will see that I had to unnest one of the datasets because it had a row, where the other data set had a column. 

In the end, it was determined that the 2 could be separated and the reommendation was to look further into the countries that were doing so successfully, in order to reporoduce that.
